            </h2>
            <p class="lead">Version control is a system that records changes to a file or set of files over time so that you can recall specific versions later.  It allows you to revert files back to a previous state, revert the entire project back to a previous state, compare changes over time, see who last modified something that might be causing a problem, who introduced an issue and when, and more. Using a VCS also generally means that if you screw things up or lose files, you can easily recover.  There are three types: Local, Centralized, and Distributed.</p>

            </h2>
            <p class="lead">Git is a version control system and was created as a new system that encompassed speed, a simple design, strong support for non-linear development (thousands of parallel branches), fully distributed, and able to handle large projects.  Since it’s birth in 2005, Git has evolved and matured to be easy to use and yet retain these initial qualities. It’s incredibly fast, it’s very efficient with large projects, and it has an incredible branching system for non-linear development.</p>

                <span class="text-muted">Repository</span>
            </h2>
            <p class="lead">A Repository is a central location in which data is stored and managed.  In this lesson, we learned to adding files to a remote repository from a local repository using Git and Cloud 9.  Pushing the files from the local repository to the remote repository does this. The Repository is useful because it provides a place where the data can be stored and managed.

            </h2>
            <p class="lead">Git Status is used to show all the files that were changed since the last back up and which ones are already added to the staging area. It is used to track new files and also to stage already tracked files.  Other statements like “Git Diff” and “Git Log” are others similar to this statement but they perform other tasks.

            <p class="lead">The local repository in this assignment is Cloud 9.  We pushed files from this local repository to the remote repository which is Git.  The local repository is the original copy of the data and information that is shared to the remote repository.
